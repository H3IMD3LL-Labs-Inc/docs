<Info>
    v1.0.0 will introduce breaking changes to this documentation
</Info>

<Warning>
    - Rust version 1.89.0 or higher is required when building from source, run `rustup update` to update your Rust version. See [installing Rust](https://rust-lang.org/install)
    - libprotoc version 30.2 or higher is required to run VES. Make sure you have an updated version of Protoc installed. Visit [protobuf.dev](https://protobuf.dev/installation/) to install libprotoc.

This guide is intended for use when developing the Core Agent locally, if you're interested in using the Core Agent locally. See [running an instance locally](../ves-v0.1.0/getting-started)

Building the latest version of the source code locally on Linux and Windows takes ~10 minutes, use the following steps

<Steps>
    <Step title="Clone the latest version locally">
        Go to [latest source version](https://github.com/H3IMD3LL-Labs-Inc/VES/tree/main), copy the repo web URL

        <Frame>
            <img src="/images/ves_repo_web_url.png" alt="Repo web URL" />
        </Frame>

        On your laptop's terminal, preferably in your $HOME directory, clone the repo

        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/H3IMD3LL-Labs-Inc/VES.git
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Build an executable binary from your local repo">
        Go to the repo's root directory and run the cargo build command to get an executable binary

        ```bash
        cd VES
        cargo build --release --locked
        ```

        <Note>
            The `--locked` when building the source ensures you use the exact dependency version specified in the **`Cargo.lock`** file, **DO NOT manually edit this file!**
        </Note>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Ensure the executable binary exists">
        Find your executable binary located here, from the repo's root directory

        <Tabs>
            <Tab title="Linux">
                ```bash
                cd target/release
                ```
            </Tab>
            <Tab title="Windows">
                ```bash
                cd target\release
                ```
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>

        <Frame>
            <img src="/images/executable_binary_location.png" alt="Executable binary location" />
        </Frame>
    </Step>
</Steps>
