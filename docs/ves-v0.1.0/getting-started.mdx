<Info>
    v1.0.0 will introduce breaking changes to this documentation
</Info>

<Warning>
    - Rust version 1.89.0 or higher is required when building from source, run `rustup update` to update your Rust version. See [installing Rust](https://rust-lang.org/install)
    - libprotoc version 30.2 or higher is required to run VES. Make sure you have an updated version of Protoc installed. Visit [protobuf.dev](https://protobuf.dev/installation/) to install libprotoc.
</Warning>


<Steps>

    <Step title="Install the repo locally">
        Clone the repo locally in **$HOME** directory, and enter the root directory

        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/H3IMD3LL-Labs-Inc/VES.git
        cd VES
        ```
        To update your current version of VES to try new features, run the following command before each configuration + build

        ```bash
        cd VES
        git pull origin main
        ```
        <Note>
            Updating your version from the main repo may introduce breaking changes as this will often contain the latest-unstable version
        </Note>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Configure VES before building">
        Currently, the Core Agent is configured via the TOML configuration file. To set your own configuration options, edit the file located at

        ```bash
        cd VES/services/log-collector/src/config
        ```
        Edit the configuration file based on how you'd like to use the Core Agent. See [configuration options](../guides/configuration#core-agent-configuration)
        <Note>
            The current version of VES (v0.1.0) does not support does not support configuration at runtime. Ensure you have configured your instance before building.
        </Note>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Build an executable binary from your local repo">
        Go to the repo's root directory and run the cargo build command to get an executable binary

        ```bash
        cd VES
        cargo build --release --locked
        ```

        <Note>
            The `--locked` when building the source ensures you use the exact dependency version specified in the **`Cargo.lock`** file, **DO NOT manually edit this file!**
        </Note>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Run the executable binary 🚀">
        Go to the executable binary's location, set execute instructions(for Linux) and run it

        <Tabs>
            <Tab title="Linux">
                Go to the compiled binary location and grant execute permissions
                ```bash
                cd target/release
                chmod +x ves
                ```
                Confirm the binary has execute permissions
                ```bash
                ./ves help
                ```
                <Note>
                    You should see instructions for running the binary in your terminal after running the above command, otherwise the binary does not have execute permissions
                </Note>

                Run the binary 🚀
                ```bash
                ./ves run
                ```
            </Tab>

            <Tab title="Windows">
                Go to the compiled binary location and confirm the binary works **using powershell**
                ```bash
                cd target\release
                .\ves.exe help
                ```

                <Note>
                    You should see instructions for running the binary in your terminal, otherwise something went wrong
                </Note>

                Run the binary 🚀
                ```bash
                .\ves.exe run
                ```
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>

    </Step>

</Steps>

You should now have a local running VES (Core Agent) instance! You are now collecting and processing observability data from the source you configured earlier.
